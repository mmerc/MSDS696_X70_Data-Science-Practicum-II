# Predicting Chronic Kidney Disease with Machine Learning Techniques.
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is the loss of kidney function over a long period of time. The kidneys filter waste chemicals from the blood, secrete harmones that alter blood pressure and red blood cell production, and they regulate electrolytes. This disease affects affects 30 million individuals in the United States and is most often caused by diabetes and high blood pressure (NKF, 2017).

This paper decribes the process to predict the presence of Chronic Kidney Disease using machine learning techniques. The models utlized for this project are the random forest classifier and support vector machine (SVM) contained in the sklearn package. The process for this project includes exploratory data analysis, data cleansing, establishing a training and test sample, application of the machinine learning model and evaluating the performance of each model.

### Dataset
The dataset is the "Chronic_Kidney_Disease Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (UCI, 2015). The data consisted of 400 samples of patient data on 24 features related to chronic kidney disease. The 25th feature was the dependent variable on whether the patient had chronic kidney disease. Another aspect of this project was to compare the performance of each model on variations of the dataset. I was interested to learn if less samples with more features yielded different results as compare to more samples with less features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The features included in this data set are the common tests used to diagnose kidney disease such as urine characteristics, and blood tests, as well as medical history and a few physical findings. As the kidney function declines through progressive cellular damage, alterations in the composition of the urine, the blood chemistries, and physical features occur.
